# QuantizingProgram

## Description:
This project reads an RGB image (24-bit, 8 bits per channel)
and applies scalar quantization to reduce it to an 8-bit image. The processed image is then saved.

## How to Run:
1. Place the image in the root directory (or provide the path in the `QuantizingProgram.java` file).
2. Modify the paths for the input and output images in the code as needed.
3. Run the program using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or via the command line.

## Supported Formats:
- Input: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`
- Output: `.jpg` (modifiable to `.png` or `.bmp`)

## Requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or later).
